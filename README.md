Simple blogg application

My first contact with saas/scss styling.

This is simple blog app where you can add posts, edit them, delete, add images and delete them. Login page, register page, and common blog feature.

Tech stack used. JS, React, react router dom, scss, express, mysql.

This is not finished app, it has missing functionalities which i will try to fix in the future.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
